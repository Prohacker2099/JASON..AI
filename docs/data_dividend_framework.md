# JASON Data Dividend Framework

## Vision & Philosophy

The Data Dividend Framework represents a paradigm shift in how smart home data is valued, shared, and monetized. Built on principles of user ownership, transparency, and fair compensation, this framework establishes JASON as the pioneer of ethical data practices in the smart home industry.

### Core Principles

1. **User Data Ownership**: Users own their data completely. JASON is merely the steward.
2. **Explicit Consent**: No data is shared without clear, specific, and revocable consent.
3. **Fair Compensation**: Users receive direct compensation for the value their data creates.
4. **Transparency**: All data usage, sharing, and monetization is fully transparent.
5. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy protections are built into every aspect of the framework.
6. **Collective Bargaining**: Users gain leverage through collective participation.
7. **Ethical Partnerships**: Only partners who adhere to strict ethical standards are eligible.
